   * Return a paginated result instead of a simple list.

3. **Update the Controller**

   * Update your endpoint to accept a `page` parameter.
   * Pass the page information to the service layer and then to the view.

4. **Update the Thymeleaf View**

   * Modify your list view to show only a subset of books per page.
   * Add pagination controls that allow users to navigate through pages.
   * Ensure that when filters are applied, pagination links maintain those filters.
